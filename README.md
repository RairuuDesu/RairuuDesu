Hi hi~

I'm RairuuDesu (also goes by viie). I like to make random projects (mostly in c++). I'm also making a game in unity! I like to play Terraria, Minecraft, and Dani's games as well.

I'm currently working on a Discord Music Bot (ViieRythm) and a sort of c++ rpg game you can play on your terminal.

I'm learning javascript (specifically node.js) alongside making my bot!

That's about it though, seeya!
